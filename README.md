# ThinkLink
Just like me, most of you, who are young but lazy get an idea(somewhat like me) or experience the moment where you think, only if this “X” would have existed my life would have been easier but the second moment you just move on with your life as you always do just like everyone else does, Why’s that you ask? because it is just too insignificant to ask and you are made for bigger things, if you keep playing around with small stuff, how would the world progress? right? This is the easiest way to be a real entrepreneur, you know what the problem is, you know what the solution is, why not build it? why hesitate? After analyzing my behavior and a lot of “this happens to me too” moments I finally decided that just like me another 100 not if 1000 people think about that idea. 

That’s why I am proposing “ThinkLink”, whenever you come across such moments, just post what happened to you, and how it could have been easier if something extra that is not yet available would have been. If other users have experienced the same thing and want a solution, they can engage with you along with other community members in the conversation and you have your validation for the requirement of the product. 

And it’s not over yet…

The main advantage it offers is, the team to build the product. If 100 people need that thing at least 5 people can take it as a project, they are already aware of the problem so it is extremely easy to get rolling, otherwise, you know how difficult it can be to find a good team member to a founding engineer.

There are no restrictions to how bigger this product can get, it can be finished in a few weeks and it can also help you with the startup you’ve long been looking for, who knows

Enough of my blabbering of personal life, let’s get to product description(and thank you for sticking with my story)

**ThinkLink is an innovative web platform designed to bridge the gap between everyday problems and collaborative solutions. It provides a space for individuals to share their "I wish this existed" moments, validate ideas through community feedback, and collaborate on bringing solutions to life**
